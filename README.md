1. Project Title - "Geo-App"
This project is an educational game in the field of Geography to help high-school students with their learning.

2. Motivation for the project
The push for STEM subjects in schools today has led to a lack of engagement in non-STEM subjects. This leads to poorer grades amongst the non-STEM subjects and could ultimately lead to less funding. This is a problem that we wanted to address. Our motivation was to give the students a fun way of learning inside and outside of the Geography classroom.

3. Build status
The product is in the Beta phase of production.

4. Code style
We have used a standard code style.

5. Tech/Framework used
This project uses, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and Javascript.

6. Features 
Features we though would be good for the User Experience consist of:
    - Difficulty settings. If a learner starts a quiz and it is far too hard for them, they are not very likely to try the quiz again, giving the user the option to start from an easier setting gives them a steady pace at which to learn and they will be less likey to give up.
    - A scoring sytem. We believed that a score board and the ability to see how other learners are doing would incentivise competative students to practice more in order to increase their rank.
    - Multiple choice quiz questions. Sometimes learners find it diffficult to access information so readily. With multiple-choice questions, a learner can feel more confident in answering and the experience will be slightly quicker, leading to faster learning times.
    - Instant feedback. When a learner can see immediate feedback, it can be rewarding for them to see, or they can instantly make notes on any errors as they arise.

7. How to use?
